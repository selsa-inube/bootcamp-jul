# Conventional Commits

This project and all the projects we will be working in the future, demand the use of conventional commits as a standard for creating commit messages.
Check the documentation to see how to use it:

https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

**Note**: All the commits in this bootcamp are controlled by commitlint, so you won't be able to commit without this knowledge.
