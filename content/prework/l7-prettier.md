# Prettier

During this bootcamp and all future projects you will be using Prettier to format the code. This means that the structure of the code will be exactly as Prettier decides it should be, not how you want it to be.

Although this project auto formats the code whenever you commit your code, it is recommended that you also have Prettier working on your local environment so you can format everytime you save your code. Like this, you can see how the files will be saved in git even before you create the commit.

Follow these steps to install and configure Prettier in your VS Code.

1. Install the extension: "Prettier - Code formatter" in VS Code.
2. Go to settings in VS Code.
3. In the search bar type: "Editor: formatter"
4. In the Editor: Default Formatter rule, select Prettier
5. In the Editor: Format On Save rule, activate the checkbox.
