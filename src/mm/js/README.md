# road graph

## Modules

### Graph Module (`graph.js`)

**function**:This module will be responsible for building and managing the graph that represents the routes.

### Routes Module (routes.js)

**function**:Define the roads and export the road network.

### Main Module (main.js)

**function**:This module will combine the previous modules and run the main logic of the program.

## Dependencies

- main.js depends on graph.js and routes.js.
- graph.js does not have dependencies on other modules.
- routes.js does not depend on other modules.

## previously written in NPM

- graphlib: A library for working with graphs.

## I prefer to use an NPM library because they are tested and optimized, which can save us time.
