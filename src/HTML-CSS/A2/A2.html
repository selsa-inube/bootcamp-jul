          <strong>Declarative:</strong> React makes it painless to create
          interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
          application, and <br />
          React will efficiently update and render just the right components
          when your data changes. Declarative views make your <br />code more
          predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Component-Based:</strong> Build encapsulated components that
          manage their own state, then compose them to make complex <br />
          UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of
          templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app <br />
          and keep the state out of the DOM.

          <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere:</strong> We don't make assumptions
          about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop <br />
          new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also
          render on the server using Node and power mobile <br />

      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and
        <strong>you can use as little or as much React as you need.</strong>

        You can use React as a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag from a
        <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none">CDN</a>, or as a
        react package on

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We have several examples
        <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none">on the website</a
        >. Here is the first one to get you started:
      </p>
      <pre><code>import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello {name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);</code></pre>
      <p>
        This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <p>
        You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;
        <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none">we call it JSX</a
        >. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable,
        <br />
        and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a
        <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, read
        <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none">this section</a>
        on integrating JSX; otherwise, <br />
        the
        <a href="#" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none"
          >recommended JavaScript toolchains</a
        >
        handle it automatically.
