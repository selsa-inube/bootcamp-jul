    <h1>React</h1>
    <p>React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Declarative: </strong>react makes it painless to create
        interactive Ul. Desing simple views for each states in your application,
        and React will efficiently update and render just the right components
        when your data changes. Declaratives views make your code more
        predicable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-Based: </strong>Build encapsulated components that
        manage their own state, then compose them to make complex Uls. Since
        component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
        easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the
        DOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere: </strong>We don't make assumptions
        about the rest of your technology stack, so you can delevop new feature
        in react woithout rewriting exiting code. React can also render on the
        server using Node and power mobile apps using
        <a href="https://reactnative.dev/"> React Native </a>

      React has been desingned for gradual adoption from the start, and
      <strong>you can us as litlle or as much React as your need:</strong>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      you can use React as a script tag from a
      <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">CDN</a>, or as a
      React package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react">npm</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      You can find the React documentation
      <a href="https://react.dev/">on the website</a>. <br />

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      We have several examples <a href="https://react.dev/">on the website</a>.
      Here is the first one to get you started:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

            function HelloMensage ({ name }) {
                return <div>hello {name}</div>;
            }

            const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
            root.render(<HelloMensage name="Taylor"/>);
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>this example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      you'll notice that we used an HTML-like sintax;
      <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"
        >we call its JSX</a
      >. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and
      writing it feels like writing HTML. if you're using React as a script tag,
      read
      <a
        href="https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#optional-try-react-with-jsx"
        >this section</a
      >
      on integrating JSX; otherwise, the
      <a href="https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project"
        >recommended JavaScript toolchains</a
      >
      handle it automatically.
    </p>
