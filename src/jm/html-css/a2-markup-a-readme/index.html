    <h1>React</h1>
    <p>React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Declarative: </strong>react makes it painless to create
        interactive Ul. Desing simple views for each states in your aplication,
        and React will efficiently update and render just the right components
        when your data changes. Declaratives views make your code more
        predicable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Component-Based: </strong>Build encapsulated components that
        manage their own state, then compose them to make complex Uls. Since
        component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
        easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the
        DOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere: </strong>We don't make assumptions
        about the rest of your technology stack, so you can delevop new feature
        in react woithout rewriting exiting code. React can also render on the
        server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Learn how to us React in you project</p>

    <h2>intallation</h2>
    <p>
      React has been desingned for gradual adoption from the start, and
      <strong>you can us as litlle or as much React as your need:</strong>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste for React.</li>
      <li>Add React to a website as a script tag in one minnute.</li>
      <li>
        Create New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript
        toolchain.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      you can use React as a script tag from a CDN, or as a React package on
      npm.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      You can find the React documentation on the website. <br />
      check out the Getting Started page for a quick over view. <br />
      The documentationis divided into several sections:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tutorial</li>
      <li>Main Concepts</li>
      <li>Advanced Guides</li>
      <li>API References</li>
      <li>Where To Get Support</li>
      <li>Contributing Guide</li>
    </ul>

    <p>you can improve it by sending pull request to this repository.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you
      started:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

            function HelloMensage ({ name }) {
                return <div>hello {name}</div>;
            }

            const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));
            root.render(<HelloMensage name="Taylor"/>);
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>this example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      you'll notice that we used an HTML-like sintax; we call its JSX. JSX is
      not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it
      feels like writing HTML. if you're using React as a script tag, read thix
      section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript
      toolchains handle it automatically.
    </p>
