    <span> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces </span>

        <p>
          <strong>Declarative:</strong>React makes it painless to create
          interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
          application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
          right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your
          code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Component-Based:</strong>Build encapsulated components that
          manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since
          component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can
          easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the
          DOM.

          <strong>Learn Once, Write Anywhere: </strong> We don't make
          assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can
          develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React
          can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using

        React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and
        <strong> you can use as little or as much React as you need:</strong>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        We have several examples
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/">on the website</a>. Here is the first one
        to get you started:
      </p>
      <article>
        <span>
          <p>import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";</p>
          <br />
          <p>function HelloMessage({ name }) {</p>
          <p>return &lt;/div&gt;Hello {name} &lt;/div&gt;;<br />}</p>
          <br />
          <p>const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("container"));</p>
          <p>root.render(&lt;HelloMessage name="Taylor" /&gt;);</p>
        </span>
      </article>
      <p>
        This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.
      </p>
      <span>
        You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">
          we call it JSX</a
        >. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable,and
        writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a
        &lt;script&gt; tag, read
        <a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx"
        >
          this section</a
        >
        on integrating JSX; otherwise,the
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">
          recommended JavaScript toolchains</a
        >
        handle it automatically.
